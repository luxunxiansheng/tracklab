**Algorithm**: Temporal Consistency Enhancement via Tracklet Voting

**Core Technology**: Confidence-weighted Voting Across Temporal Windows

**Detailed Algorithm Description**:

This post-processing module improves jersey number consistency across video sequences by leveraging temporal information:

**Tracklet Analysis**:

- **Input**: Individual frame jersey detections with confidence scores
- **Processing**: Groups detections by track ID to form temporal sequences
- **Voting Mechanism**: Applies confidence-weighted voting within each tracklet
- **Consistency Enforcement**: Ensures jersey numbers remain stable across frames

**Voting Algorithm**:
For each tracklet with jersey number detections \(d_1, d_2, \dots, d_n\) and confidences \(c_1, c_2, \dots, c_n\):

**Weighted Voting Process**:

1. **Candidate Collection**: Gather all unique jersey numbers in the tracklet
2. **Confidence Aggregation**: Sum confidence scores for each candidate number
3. **Winner Selection**: Choose the number with highest total confidence
4. **Tracklet Assignment**: Apply the winning number to all frames in the tracklet

**Mathematical Formulation**:

For jersey number candidate \(j\) in tracklet \(t\):

**Confidence Score Calculation:**

```math
S_j = Σ(i=1 to n) c_i × δ(d_i = j)
```

**Winner Selection:**

```math
j_winner = argmax_j S_j
```

**Where:**

- \(S_j\): Total confidence score for candidate \(j\)
- \(c_i\): Confidence of detection \(i\)
- \(\delta\): Indicator function (1 if detection equals candidate, 0 otherwise)
- \(\Sigma\): Sum over all detections in the tracklet
- \(\arg\max\): Argument of the maximum (returns the candidate with highest score)

**Temporal Consistency Features**:

- **Tracklet Smoothing**: Reduces flickering between different jersey numbers
- **Outlier Rejection**: Filters inconsistent detections within tracklets
- **Confidence Propagation**: Uses high-confidence detections to correct low-confidence ones
- **Multi-frame Validation**: Leverages temporal context for better accuracy

**Key Features**:

- **Temporal Smoothing**: Eliminates jersey number flickering
- **Confidence Integration**: Combines detection confidence with temporal consistency
- **Tracklet-aware Processing**: Operates on complete object trajectories
- **Post-processing Enhancement**: Improves results from any base OCR method
